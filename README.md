The Hangman Project.py file will initiate a game of Hangman when the file is executed. The list of potential words/solutions for the game of Hangman is in the words.txt file. You can add or remove words to the file as desired; each word should go on a separate line. The Hangman Project.py file and words.txt file must be placed in the same folder when ran in order to execute properly.
